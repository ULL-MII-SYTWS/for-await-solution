Examples from the chapter [Async iteration and generators](https://javascript.info/async-iterators-generators) of the <https://javascript.info> book.

1. [hello-async-iterator.js](hello-async-iterator.js) - Hello async iterator
2. For most practical applications, when weâ€™d like to make an object that asynchronously generates a sequence of values, we can use an asynchronous generator.

    The syntax is simple: prepend `function*` with `async`. That makes the generator asynchronous.

    And then use `for await (...)` to iterate over it. See: [async-generators-finally.js](async-generators-finally.js)
3. Regular generators can be used instead of `Symbol.iterator` to make the iteration simpler.

   Similar to that, async generators can be used instead of `Symbol.asyncIterator` to implement the asynchronous iteration.

   For instance, we can make the range object generate values asynchronously, once per second as in [async-iterable-range.js](async-iterable-range.js):
